This project is a command-line Research Object management tool, following the specification at http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+management+tool, which is in turn derived from http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+command+line+tool.  Details of the command line interface are expected to evolve as the software is developed.

Documentation about using the tool is at http://wf4ever.github.com/ro-manager/doc/RO-manager.html

Installation instructions can be found in the README file in the src directory (https://github.com/wf4ever/ro-manager/blob/master/src/README).
