ro-manager

This project is a command-line Research Object management tool, following the specification at http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+management+tool, which is in turn derived from http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+command+line+tool.  Details of the command line interface are expected to evolve as the software is developed.

Documentation about using the tool is at http://wf4ever.github.com/ro-manager/doc/RO-manager.html and http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+Manager+FAQ.  (As of October 2012, the FAQ documentation is more up to date.)

Installation instructions can be found in the README file in the "src" directory (https://github.com/wf4ever/ro-manager/blob/master/src/README.md).

As a first step to using "gitflow" branching structures (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
a "develop" branch has been created.  In due course, the "master" branch should only ever contain production code
that has been published to PyPI.

I have not yet created branches for releases or feature development
I'm taking a view that these can be created as required.
Many developments may take place on a local branch and be pushed straight back to "develop".
